# Door Buzzer

Not the cleanest code since this is an extension of an old project.

Added Blynk to my homegrown Iot device that uses a servo to buzz the door.

To build need to create a `include/secrets.h` file with:

```c
#define SSID "YOUR_SSID"
#define WIFI_PASS "YOUR_SSID_PASS"

#define BLYNK_AUTH "YOUR_BLYNK_AUTH"
```
